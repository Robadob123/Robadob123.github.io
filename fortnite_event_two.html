    <h2>1.  Travis Scott concert</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        
        On the 23 -25 of April in 2020, there was an epic concert event in Fortnite. 
        It was Travis Scott! The concert featured Travis Scott without his shirt, and he danced while 
        singing some of his top rated songs. Some of his songs was FRANCHISE, 
        The Plan, HIGHEST IN THE ROOM, THE SCOTTSTHE SCOTTS and many more. The Travis Scott event was epic, 
        because it caused the players to float in space for a little while. It was liked by many big streamers 
        on twitch, and Travis Scott even gott his own fortnite remote after the concert. The emote was him 
        lifting a microphone stand, while it was on fire.

    <h2>2. The Galactus event</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        
        
        The Galactus event was a Marvel collab with Fortnite. Fortnite wanted something most people who played
         their game liked, and made an epic Marvel event. The event started on December.1.2020, 
         and was streamed by LazarBeam, Ninja, Fresh and many more streamers. The Galactus event was about the 
         super villain “Galactus”. We as the players had to stop Galactus from destroying the world. Galactus
          was huge, but luckily the Avengers from Marvel were introduced to the event to help us. 
          Some of the avengers were Thor, Groot and Iron Man. The fortnite players were in battle buses,
           where they had weapons to take down Galactus, and in the end they did luckily defeat him.

    <h2>3. Earthquake</h2>    
  
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">

    
        
        In season 7 a mysterious earthquake arrived on the Fortnite map. No one knows why this happened,
         but maybe the creators of Fortnite wanted something fun and exciting for their players to speculate. 
         For many it was an early test to see the Fortnite event updates by the creators of Fortnite. 
         The earthquake wasn't so big, and it barely did anything when people played the game.

    <h2>4.  New Year 2020 </h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        
        
        When it was the new year in 2020, the creators of Fortnite wanted something fun, and memorable from 
        the year 2020. And therefore they made a new year 2020 event in Fortnite. The event started with a
         giant disco ball which counted down from 10. When the timer hit zero, the disco ball exploded. 
         That created spectacular fireworks, and made every player on the Fortnite map dance. At the end of
          the show, was it one last firework, and when it exploded was it portrayed as a llama and 2020
           written over the llama.

    <h2>5.  The Butterfly Event
    </h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
       
        
        In November.4.2018 in season 4, there was a rather odd event in Fortnite. 
        It was about the cube (read more about the cube in: *link). The cube was floating in the air,
         with some rocks that floated from the force giving from the purple cube. The itself was generating 
         energy, while it was rotating, and sonner exploded. The players who were next to the cube were in a 
         blink of an eye sent to a white endless void. There the fortnite players could see each other,
          in the void. But it wouldn't last long as there was a blue-ish butterfly coming towards the players. 
          Later there was a cutscene where the players would hold the butterfly on their fingertip, and arrive
           back to the map. When the players arrived back to the map, they discovered the ruins from the cube
            laying right in the middle of the map.
